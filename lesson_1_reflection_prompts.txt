How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    By narrowing the code down to the lines where any differences between
    the two codes lye, it is much easier to quickly spot it

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    By recognising certain development patterns in the history of the file confident
    can learn more quickly how to code in a better way much faster

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: Identify logical unit change
    Cons: We are not infallible in doing the above

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git has a different architecture, allowing for repositories, such that a
    relation between different files in it is implied and changes must affect
    all of them. In the absence of such a structure, Google docs treat each
    file separately

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log shows the entire history of the files
    Git diff allows one to compare any two version in the history


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It is reassuring knowing that there is a log of version saved somewhere

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
